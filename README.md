## 🦊 Hi, I'm Alex!

Mostly know as FluffyKn1ght in online space, I'm yet another random person from Russia who likes technology, programming and game development. I am very good at English (as you can see) and often connect with other folks around the globe.
I am interested in the Japanese culture (this includes but is not limited traditional Japan, anime/manga and modern Japan).

💻 **Programming Languages**: Python, Lua and GDScript, however, I know a teeny-tiny bit of Java and C#.
🎓 **Learning Goals**: Web development, including HTML+CSS, JavaScript and Svelte.
💫 **Life Job Goal**: System Administrator (aka the "IT guy") or a programmer of some kind.

## Current Project: Horizons
A pixel-art survival sandbox RPG made in Godot in collabaration with [@LonelyFear](https://github.com/LonelyFear).
⏩ You can check it out and contribute to it in this repo: https://github.com/FluffyKn1ght/Horizons

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Am I open to collaboration?** - Sometimes yeah, sometimes no. Mostly no, unfortunately.

**How did I get into programming/computers/technology?** - I had a computer when I was young (I still do, obviously?)

**What are my current system specs?** - Intel Core i5-12400F; 16GB of DDR4 RAM, SSD+HDD for storage, and an RTX 3050 for my GPU.

**What IDE do I use?** - Mostly JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ or PyCharm (Community versions). I don't hate VS Code, I just don't think it's the right fit for me.
